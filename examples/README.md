Examples
========

* [Manifest](manifest.yaml) - A complete manifest for the controller, with RBAC.
* [ingress-nginx](ingress-nginx-deployment.yaml) - Example deployment
  for ingress-nginx with hostPorts and annotations.
* [external-dns](external-dns-deployment.yaml) - Example deployment
  for external-dns. Nothing specific to the controller, but it can be
  useful in combination with it, and it shows how to make it work with
  CNAMEs.
